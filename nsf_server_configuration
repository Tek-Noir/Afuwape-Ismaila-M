Configuration of NFS Server
  NFS = Network file system 
        distributed file system 
        shared file system 

Step 1: Install NFS Kernel Server--FOR NEW NFS SERVER CONFIGURATION for ubuntu 18.4.
Before installing the NFS Kernel server, 
  we need to update our system’s repository index with that of the Internet through the following apt command as sudo:

$ 
 sudo hostname nfs 
 sudo apt-get update

The above command lets us install the latest available version of a software through the Ubuntu repositories.

Now, run the following command in order to install the NFS Kernel Server on your system:

$ sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server -y


Step 2: Create the Export Directory

sudo mkdir -p /mnt/share/

ls -l /mnt


=# As we want all clients to access the directory,
    we will remove restrictive permissions.

sudo chown nobody:nogroup /mnt/share/
sudo chmod 777 /mnt/share/

ls -l /mnt



Step 3: Assign server access to client(s) through NFS export file .VI inside the file then enter the first line 

sudo vi /etc/exports

/mnt/share/ *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)


# To configure Ip or VPC also.
#/mnt/share/ <clientIP or Clients CIDR>(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)
 #Ex:
 


Step 4: Export the shared directory

$ sudo exportfs -a

sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server

Step 5: Open firewall for the client (s) EFS - PORT 2049

Configuring the Client Machine--- FOR WORKER NODES.

Step 1: Install NFS Common
Before installing the NFS Common application, we need to update our system’s repository index with that of the Internet through the following apt command as sudo:

$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nfs-common -y

$ sudo apt-get install nfs-common
 
    ubuntu
